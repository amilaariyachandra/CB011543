      <h1>TURTLE CATEGORIES IN SRI LANKA</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    

    <p>Sri Lanka is home to a diverse range of turtle species, each with its own unique characteristics and habitats. The sea turtles found along the Sri Lankan coast, such as Loggerhead, Green, Hawksbill, Olive Ridley, and Leatherback Turtles, undertake long migrations and face various threats. Freshwater turtles, including the Indian Flapshell Turtle and Sri Lankan Black Turtle, inhabit rivers and wetlands throughout the country. Sri Lanka also has land-dwelling turtles like the Indian Star Tortoise and Sri Lankan Tortoise, found in different habitats across the island. The rich turtle biodiversity in Sri Lanka highlights the importance of conservation efforts to protect these remarkable creatures and their habitats. </p>

<h3>(1)Green Turtle</h3>
<img class="imgcontent" src="images/green turtle.jpg" alt="Green Turtle">
<div class="contentp">
<p>The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is a species of marine turtle and is one of the most commonly found turtles in Sri Lanka. The  green turtle is named for the color of its body fat, which is green due to the turtle's herbivorous diet of seagrasses and algae.
  Green turtles can grow up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) in length and can weigh up to 200 kilograms (440 pounds). They are known for their streamlined bodies, which are designed for efficient swimming. Green turtles can be found in all oceans around the world, and they are known for their impressive migrations between nesting and feeding grounds.
  In Sri Lanka green turtles are commonly found nesting along the beaches of the Southern and Eastern coasts during the months of June to September. These nesting sites are protected by conservation efforts to ensure the survival of this species. Green turtles are considered endangered globally due to habitat loss, hunting, and accidental capture in fishing nets. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species and its habitats in Sri Lanka and around the world.Green turtles nest all year round in Sri Lanka, with the highest abundance reported in Kosgoda. </p>

<div class="contentp">
<p>
  The hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) is known for its strikingly beautiful shell with overlapping scutes. This critically endangered species has a pointed beak and primarily feeds on sponges, mollusks, and other invertebrates. Sri Lanka serves as an important nesting site for hawksbill turtles.
  Nesting sites of Sri Lanka includes Kataduwa, Bentota, Udappuwa, Kosgoda, Karaduwa, Talaimannar, Jaffna, Galkissa, Talawila, Palatupana, Amadhauwa. These turtles are found mainly in the tropical regions of the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian Oceans & Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<h3>(3)Loggerhead Turtle</h3>
<img class="imgcontent" src="images/loggerheadseaturtle.avif"  alt="Loggerhead Turtle">
<div class="contentp">
<p>Loggerhead turtles are named for their large heads that support powerful jaw muscles, allowing them to crush hard-shelled prey like clams and sea urchins. They are less likely to be hunted for their meat or shell compared to other sea turtles. Bycatch, the accidental capture of marine animals in fishing gear, is a serious problem for loggerhead turtles because they frequently come in contact with fisheries.Loggerheads are the most common turtle in the Mediterranean, nesting on beaches from Greece and Turkey to Israel and Libya. Many of their nesting beaches are under threat from tourism development. Sea turtles are the living representatives of a group of reptiles that has existed on Earth and travelled our seas for the last 100 million years. They are a fundamental link in marine ecosystems and help maintain the health of coral reefs and sea grass beds.
